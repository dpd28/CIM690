        <h2>Ami Vitale</h2>
        <p>Ami Vitale is a photojournalist who has traveled the globe and witnessed appalling crimes against humanity and the planet. Yet, she has also experienced the beauty of the universal strength of people near and far. According to her, photography is “a tool to make sense of our commonalities in the world we share”. Her work has been published in several international publications such as <em>National Geographic Magazine</em>. Ami is also a Nikon Ambassador, a member of Ripple Effect Images, a speaker, and educator. She contacted me to refresh her online presence, especially her website which in her words, “is dark, dated and not mobile-friendly”.</p>

                    <h2>POY Latam</h2>
                    <p>POYLatam is a photography competition for photographers based in Latin America. It is a volunteer-run organization operated by a ragtag group of people passionate about the power of photography. I was approached to redesign their existing web presence for the next (2017) competition. Requirements included, among others: Creation of an archive of previous winners, galleries of the current competition's winners, ability to showcase award-winning work as they were announced and give potential donors information about the competition.</p>

        <h2>Carry Me Ohio</h2>
        <p>Carry Me Ohio is volume one in The Invisible Yoke Series by photographer, Matt Eich. Matt and I have collaborated over several years on various iterations of this long-term project and his “love song to Ohio”. This book is the culmination of his provocative body of work. We worked closely with Reto Caduff of Sturm & Drang to create a template for the series. The book is 120 pages, 24.5 cm x 25 cm hardcover, linen printed and embossed with 16-page insert “Spitting in the Devil’s Eye”.</p>

                  <h2>Lynn Johnson</h2>
                  <p>Lynn Johnson is a National Geographic contract photographer and educator based in Pittsburgh, PA. We hunkered down in Syracuse to hash out the best way to transition her original Flash-based website to a more modern and mobile-friendly website solution. Lynn’s requirements: Low budget, easy-to-update, and no need to hire a developer. We decided on a base template from Squarespace and I used CSS to customize various elements to align more with her tastes and vision. Her new website launch was timed with the release of her story, Blast Force: The Invisible War on the Brain and her one-on-one conversation with Vince Musi at The National Geographic Photography Seminar (2015).</p>
